I love this game, but I don't have the time to grind.
If you want to support me, buy me a candy https://ko-fi.com/billythecoffee

To do:
<br> Clean up the code
<br> Add more features, like arena fighting, miscrit hunting, etc
<br> Make it so that the script works in all enviroments (script works on sunflowers and light green bushes in the forest so far)

Usage instruction:

<br> 1 - git clone the repo or download the files as zip and extract them
<br> 2 - pip install -r requirements.txt
<br> pip install opencv-python
<br> 3 - Open up miscrits and make sure you are in the starting area or near one of the elements shown in the assets/png directory e.g elements00.png
<br> 4 - Execute the script in your shell of preference and enjoy automatic farming, leveling and training!

PD: I initially developed the script using a VMware windows instance, therefore try keep the game in windowed mode and make sure under its settings that the expanded view is turned off, this is for avoiding issues regarding pyautogui's opencv image detection using the png assets
